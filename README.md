# Classifying Handwritten Digits

This repository contains implementations for classifying handwritten digits, including three main approaches:

## 1. Single-Layer Neural Network
- **Description:** This implementation is derived from the book and demonstrates the foundational concepts of a single-layer neural network for digit classification.

## 2. Two-Layer Neural Network
- **Description:** This extends the single-layer implementation from the book, adding an additional layer to enhance learning capacity. The architecture follows the design principles outlined in the accompanying presentation.

## 3. Implementation Using PyTorch
- **Description:** A modern implementation leveraging PyTorch to build and train a neural network for digit classification, showcasing the ease of development and efficiency provided by this library.
